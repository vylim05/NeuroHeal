## About

Our idea is a concussion recovery and data collection app. Many features go into a successful recovery, such as screen time, movement, sleep, walking patterns, and noise, that can be monitored by a phone and used to train a machine learning model to estimate recovery time and maximize success. From a user experience perspective, we plan to offer a step-by-step interactive experience to guide the user through their recovery period.

## Goals
Our app Tracks the progress of the healing journey.
Instruct users the things to do and not to do.
Notify users when environmental factors are too overwhelming.

## Process
To start, we used Figma to design a model of what we envisioned the app to be and what is expected on the frontend. On the other hand, to actually implement it, we used Flutter through Visual Studio Codes to write code that designed the app look and the objectives at each time period. Another implementation we particularly looked at was sound sensors, it basically detects how loud the environment is . If the volume reaches a specific decibel, then it is displays a warning that tells the user to lower the volume for best recovery progress.
